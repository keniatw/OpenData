# Open Educational Datasets Pilot

The primary outcome of this work will be a web-based hub for open educational datasets and related learning resources. The data sources will be structured around critical issues or driving questions that K-12 classrooms might explore. A pilot version of the hub will be completed by 6/28/2023 in order to share the resource with K-12 teachers and seek feedback. The pilot website will focus on datasets and educational resources around climate change, elections, and criminal justice. Where possible, users will have the option to include demographic data in any data set. Demographic data may come from several federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Census Bureau and others (see http://www.insidepolitics.org/states.html).

\* We kept the variable name as it is in the original data sets (from NCEI/NOAA); however, “state” could be renamed to “region” since it refers to 63 regions [KTW to add list].
